# rOpenSci Montreal QCBS talk

by Scott Chamberlain

A talk made with [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)

## Reproduce this talk

My repo of talk is pretty big, sorry about that. Working on reducing size by reducing duplicated dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/sckott/talks
cd talks/montreal3
open index.html
```

To use grunt/npm (you have to have npm installed of course)

```
git clone https://github.com/sckott/talks
cd talks/montreal3
npm install
grunt serve
```

Then go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view your presentation
