## Closed source software is great!

## Yeah, but open source is better for a lot of reasons
</center>

---

## It's free!

---

## Bugs can get fixed quickly

<center>![](assets/img/bugs.png)</center>

---

## User community helps each other (see [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/))

### i.e., you can get help much faster than with closed-source software

<center>![](assets/img/stackoverflow.png)</center>

---

## Additional functionality added as fast as you can write the code

## Be a good open source citizen

+ Contribute code
<br>
+ Can't code? Contribute documentation
<br>
+ Report bugs
<br>
+ Stackoverflow/etc. - Do your homework before asking questions

---
 
## Making open source software

+ Version control 
+ Collaboration
+ Documentation
+ Development framework
+ Testing
+ Give it a proper home

---

## R 

+ Version control: ideally [git](http://git-scm.com/)
+ Collaboration: [Github](https://github.com/)
+ Documentation: [roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html)
+ Development framework: [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools)
+ Testing: [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat)
+ Give it a proper home: [Github](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

---

## Building community in open source

+ Soooooo important (unlike companies, OS needs people, redundancy when some lose interest, etc.)
+ Be nice! (super important)
+ Make it easy to contribute (good docs, respond to pull requests, etc.)
+ Google groups/or similar
+ Get a Stackoverflow tag

---

## Getting credit for software development

+ There currently are very few incentives for software dev
+ Papers give credit, but not best way to talk about software
+ Shouldn't we get credit for the software itself - not papers about the software?
+ NSF starting to recognize other products in academia, including data, physical collections, curriculum material and **SOFTWARE**!!! See [here](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf11001/gpg_2.jsp#dmp)

---

## Licenses 

+ Use permissive licenses
+ No one best license - do your research
+ GitHub has help for you on this at [http://choosealicense.com/](http://choosealicense.com/)
+ OS licenses on the Open Source Initiative site [here](http://opensource.org/licenses)
