I’ve attached the syllabus so you can see the sort of things we’re covering. We’re emphasizing three things: data wrangling, data visualizations, and reproducible workflows. I’d love if you could talk about some of the great work you all are doing at ropensci and specifically the importance of transparency, reproducible research, etc.

We have class from 10-11:50 every Tuesday/Thursday. Yesterday was our very first class. Most people in the class have very limited exposure to R and are really just getting started, so it might be best to wait a few weeks to have you, but we’d love to have you anytime that works for you. Please let me know a date or two that you’d prefer and I can bump things around in the syllabus.

If you can make it down to Eugene for your talk that would be amazing, but if it works better for you we could certainly video-conference you in.

I’m really flexible in terms of the content and if there’s something you’d like to cover I’m certainly open to that, but I was hoping you could talk about open science and reproducible research through R, similar to your slides here: https://scotttalks.info/ossps/. To save you work you could probably just give that talk, actually, if you’d like.

The class is an hour and fifty minutes and you could have up to the entire class period, if  you’d like, or just the first hour if you’d prefer (or even less if you’re short on time that day). I’m envisioning you basically giving the talk and then allowing time for some Q & A.

I like the idea of discussing some code as well and potentially having them try to run some things. I think it would be great if we could have them run some things while you’re actually here, if you’re able to make it down locally, and if not then we can try to run through it as a class after the video conference call.

The students have not used git and we will likely not focus on it during any lectures, but if it would be helpful I could do a brief intro before your talk.

The students are very mixed, but are all in the social sciences. We have a few business marketing students, some psychology students, and the rest are in educational research (special education and educational measurement, mostly). My guess is their level of knowledge is probably going to be a bit less than you’re accustomed to. As I mentioned in the first email, for many of the students this is their first real venture into R and the basis of their stats knowledge came through working with SPSS. Most students had jumped into R to conduct a specific analysis or two prior to this class, but all mentioned just copying and pasting code without really understanding it. We’ve only had one week of class, but students are definitely still trying to just get comfortable writing code, rather than using a GUI.

But, with that said, they’re all anxious to learn and are definitely not intimidated by it. In fact there’s a lot of enthusiasm for R already, even though we’re just getting started. Does that help?

Yes, they should know what you're talking about when referencing git, or at least I'll make sure they do before your talk, if they don't know currently.
