# ideas
- summarize most common use cases, tabulated from literature ?
    - for: taxize, rgbif, rnoaa, rfishbase, rentrez, rotl, spocc
- cover stuff the other speakers aren't covering

## addressed

- slide(s) on where to find out more about each pkg, esp. for the hard/sticky things
- transitions
- clear messages of what each major pkg does ?
- zach is doing a rgbif eg, integrating with taxa, so don't do rgbif eg
